# **BassNotion Platform: Widget Catalogue (Verbose/Full Version)**

## **Mobile-First Design Principles for All Widgets**

**Core Mobile Context:**
Bass players primarily practice with their instrument in hand, making mobile devices the natural companion for practice sessions. All widgets are designed mobile-first with the following principles:

**Universal Mobile Adaptations:**

- **Touch-Optimized Controls:** Minimum 44px touch targets, gesture-based navigation
- **One-Handed Operation:** Critical controls accessible with thumb navigation
- **Portrait-First Layout:** Optimized for vertical screen orientation during practice
- **Audio-First Experience:** Visual elements support but don't overshadow audio feedback
- **Haptic Feedback:** Tactile responses for beats, note changes, and interactions
- **Background Audio:** Continuous playback when switching between apps
- **Offline Capability:** Core practice features work without internet connection

**Mobile-Specific Features:**

- **Swipe Navigation:** Between widgets, exercises, and settings
- **Pinch-to-Zoom:** For fretboard and notation viewing
- **Voice Commands:** Hands-free control during practice
- **Quick Actions:** Floating action buttons for common tasks
- **Smart Defaults:** Context-aware settings based on practice history

## **1. Connection Widget**

**Purpose:**
Designed to train the player's ability to navigate the entire fretboard across all strings and frets. This widget focuses on mastering positions, smooth transitions, and fingerboard orientation—crucial for every bass player's technical foundation.

**User Flow:**

- User selects the number of frets (e.g., up to 24) and number of strings (e.g., 4, 5, 6), reflecting their actual instrument.
- The widget generates a looping exercise—e.g., a 4-bar or 8-bar loop—where the user plays from the first fret to the last and back, repeatedly, over a chosen duration (e.g., 5 minutes).
- A play-along function provides a MIDI or audio backing track (which can be as basic as a metronome or as complex as a band mix).
- The user can mute or solo any track (bass, drums, harmony, metronome) and adjust their individual volumes.
- Utilizes the shared FretboardVisualizer component to display real-time note positions, with dynamic highlighting of current and next positions.
- Personalization: The widget remembers and defaults to user's previous instrument setup and preferences, which are shared across all widgets using the FretboardVisualizer.

**Technical/Domain Alignment:**

- Implemented as `/domains/widgets/components/ConnectionWidget/`.
- Integrates shared FretboardVisualizer from `/shared/components/music/FretboardVisualizer`
- Relies on shared audio playback engine for mixing, looping, and synchronizing MIDI/audio tracks.
- State and preferences persist via user context (stored in Supabase or local storage).
- Widget configuration and user progress are stored for analytics and next-step recommendations.

**Mobile-Specific Features:**

- **Vertical Fretboard Layout:** Optimized for portrait orientation with larger fret markers
- **Swipe Gestures:** Swipe up/down to change positions, left/right for string navigation
- **Haptic Position Feedback:** Vibration patterns for position changes and target notes
- **Large Touch Targets:** Fret positions sized for accurate finger tapping
- **Voice Position Calls:** Audio announcements of position changes for eyes-free practice

# **Widget Architecture and DDD Alignment**

- **Each widget** is a _separate bounded context aggregate_ (`/domains/widgets/`), built for independent deployment, testing, and extension.
- **Shared visualization components** (SheetPlayer and FretboardVisualizer) provide consistent music display across all widgets.
- **Playback engine** (tempo/pitch control, metronome, audio mixing) is provided by a shared service layer (`/domains/playback/`), consumed via a common API by all widgets.
- **Content and learning data** (exercise definitions, story arcs, groove cards, etc.) are provided by Content and Learning Contexts, ensuring domain logic is separated from UI/widget concerns.
- **User preferences, progress, and analytics** are tracked via User Context and stored in Supabase.
- **n8n orchestrates external integrations** (YouTube analysis, MIDI extraction, advanced audio analysis) and hands results off to widgets as required.

# **Next Steps for Implementation**

1. **Detailed User Stories:** For each widget, define a set of user stories and acceptance criteria (who, what, why, and how).
2. **Property Matrix:** Tabulate configurable options, inputs/outputs, API endpoints, events, and domain interactions for each widget.
3. **Interface Design:** Specify React/TypeScript props, backend contracts, and shared types needed for cross-team clarity.
4. **Shared Component Integration:** Document how each widget will utilize SheetPlayer and FretboardVisualizer.
5. **Prioritization:** Decide which widgets go into MVP (likely: Connection, Rhythm, Recording; others can follow).

**If you want, I can proceed with any of the above—just tell me which widget or next step to expand first!**

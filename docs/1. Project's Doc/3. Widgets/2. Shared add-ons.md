# **BassNotion Platform: Shared Visualization Components Add-On**

---

## **1. Purpose & Philosophy**

Across all widgets in BassNotion, users should have a consistent, interactive, and visually clear way to view:

- Music notation (staff, rhythm, melody, chords, tabs)
- Fretboard/neck diagrams (showing fingerings, positions, patterns)

Instead of duplicating this code in each widget, we implement **Sheet Player** and **Fretboard Visualizer** as shared, reusable UI modules—available globally within our shared component layer.

## **2. Mobile-First Design for Shared Components**

**Core Mobile Context:**
Both shared visualization components are designed mobile-first, recognizing that bass players primarily practice with mobile devices while holding their instrument.

**Universal Mobile Adaptations:**

- **Touch-Optimized Interaction:** All interactive elements sized for finger/thumb navigation
- **Gesture Support:** Pinch-to-zoom, swipe navigation, long-press for context menus
- **Portrait-First Layout:** Optimized for vertical screen orientation during practice
- **High-Contrast Visuals:** Enhanced visibility on mobile screens in various lighting conditions
- **Performance Optimized:** Efficient rendering for mobile CPU/GPU constraints
- **Responsive Scaling:** Automatic adaptation to screen sizes from 320px to 428px width

**Mobile-Specific Features:**

- **Haptic Feedback:** Tactile responses for note changes, beat emphasis, and interactions
- **Voice Integration:** Audio cues and announcements for accessibility and hands-free use
- **Offline Rendering:** Core visualization works without internet connection
- **Battery Optimization:** Efficient animation and rendering to preserve device battery

## **2. Component Overview**

### **A. Sheet Player**

**Description:**
A universal component for displaying music notation—including standard staff, tablature, chord symbols, rhythm notation, and melodic lines. Supports real-time playhead, interactivity, and various display modes.

**Core Features:**

- Renders notes, rhythms, chords, or full scores (from MusicXML, JSON, or internal notation format)
- Playhead/follow-along mode, highlighting current beat/bar
- Supports scrolling, zooming, page and line views
- Chord symbols above staff, dynamic color highlights
- Interactive: click a bar or note to loop or practice that section
- Can display both standard notation and tablature (if data available)
- Optional MIDI playback (using Tone.js)
- Theming: adapts to dark/light mode using our design system, lefty support

**Mobile-Specific Features:**

- **Horizontal Scrolling:** Optimized for mobile with smooth horizontal notation flow
- **Pinch-to-Zoom:** Natural zoom gestures with snap-to-readable sizes
- **Large Touch Targets:** Bars and notes sized for accurate finger selection (minimum 44px)
- **Auto-Follow Playhead:** Smart scrolling that keeps current position visible
- **Simplified Mobile View:** Reduced visual complexity for small screens while maintaining clarity
- **Gesture Navigation:** Swipe left/right for measures, up/down for staff systems
- **Haptic Beat Feedback:** Vibration on beat emphasis and measure boundaries
- **Voice Annotations:** Audio descriptions of chord changes and notation elements

**Primary Use-Cases:**

- Display exercises, licks, and progressions in any widget (Lick, Harmony, Rhythm, Technique, etc.)
- Visual reference for user's current practice loop or story arc challenge
- Preview for uploads or content curation (admin/editor flows)

---

### **B. Fretboard Visualizer**

**Description:**
A graphical fretboard/neck diagram renderer, showing which notes to play, finger positions, intervals, scales, chord shapes, or note sequences.

**Core Features:**

- Configurable for 4, 5, 6+ string basses; any number of frets
- Shows highlighted notes, fingerings, interval names, chord shapes
- "Playback" animation (as user or backing track advances)
- Lefty/righty mode, color-blind friendly palettes using our design tokens
- Dynamic labeling: root, scale degree, chord symbol, etc.
- Can overlay multiple positions (for comparison) or animate transitions
- Standalone or embedded in any widget

**Mobile-Specific Features:**

- **Vertical Fretboard Layout:** Portrait-optimized orientation with larger fret spacing
- **Large Fret Markers:** Touch-friendly fret positions sized for accurate finger tapping
- **Swipe Position Navigation:** Horizontal swipe to change fretboard positions
- **Pinch-to-Zoom:** Zoom in/out on specific fretboard areas for detailed viewing
- **Haptic Fret Feedback:** Vibration patterns for different note types and position changes
- **High-Contrast Mode:** Enhanced visibility for outdoor practice and bright lighting
- **Voice Position Calls:** Audio announcements of fret positions and note names
- **Quick Zoom Presets:** Double-tap for common zoom levels (full neck, position focus, single string)

**Primary Use-Cases:**

- Display connection patterns (ascending/descending), scales, arpeggios in Connection Widget
- Show target notes for licks, chords, or exercises in Lick/Harmony/Technique Widgets
- Visual feedback after user performance/recording (e.g., which notes were correct)

## **3. Architecture & Integration**

**Placement:**

- Located in `apps/frontend/src/shared/components/music/SheetPlayer` and `apps/frontend/src/shared/components/music/FretboardVisualizer`
- Exported as React components, used as children or inside any widget UI
- Follows our established component patterns using Radix UI primitives where applicable

**Usage Example:**

```tsx
// Example for using in a widget
import { SheetPlayer } from '@/shared/components/music/SheetPlayer';
import { FretboardVisualizer } from '@/shared/components/music/FretboardVisualizer';
import { usePlaybackStore } from '@/domains/playback/stores/playback.store';

export function RhythmWidget() {
  const { currentBeat, setCurrentBeat } = usePlaybackStore();

  return (
    <div>
      <SheetPlayer
        notationData={exercise.notation}
        currentBeat={currentBeat}
        showChords={true}
        theme={theme}
        onBarClick={handleBarSelect}
      />
      <FretboardVisualizer
        instrument={{
          type: 'bass',
          strings: userInstrument.strings,
          frets: userInstrument.frets,
        }}
        positions={exercise.notes}
        currentPosition={currentBeat}
        leftHanded={preferences.leftHanded}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Props/Interface (Draft):**

```ts
interface SheetPlayerProps {
  notationData: NotationData;
  currentBeat?: number;
  showChords?: boolean;
  theme?: ThemeConfig;
  highlightRange?: [number, number];
  onBarClick?: (bar: number) => void;
  midiPlayback?: boolean;
  // Mobile-specific props
  mobileOptimized?: boolean;
  touchTargetSize?: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
  hapticFeedback?: boolean;

  positions: NotePosition[];
  currentPosition?: number;
  leftHanded?: boolean;
  colorScheme?: 'default' | 'colorblind' | 'high-contrast';
  displayLabels?: 'interval' | 'note' | 'finger' | false;
  // Mobile-specific props

## **4. User Preferences & State**

- Components read from our global state management:

  - User preferences (Zustand store)
  - Theme context
  - Playback state
  - Instrument configuration

- Preferences are persisted in Supabase, with local state management through Zustand

---

## **5. Data Flow & Contracts**

- **Content Context:** Exercises, licks, and challenges contain all necessary notation, chord, and position metadata, ensuring SheetPlayer/FretboardVisualizer can be used universally.
- **Widgets:** Pass their specific data for rendering, but do not duplicate rendering logic.
- **Learning Context:** May use these for visualizations in feedback, mission/task screens, or analytics.

---

## **6. Benefits**

- **One Source of Truth** for all musical visualization—avoiding duplication and inconsistencies.
- **Rapid Feature Updates:** Improvements propagate across the entire platform at once.
- **Consistent User Experience:** Regardless of which widget is used, notation and fretboard always look and behave the same.
- **Cleaner Codebase:** Widgets are focused on business logic, not rendering.

---

## **7. Future Extensions**

- Export: Allow users to export notation/tabs or fretboard diagrams as images, PDFs, or share links.
- Advanced Interactive Features: Ear training mode, AI "auto-scroll," or adaptive difficulty overlays.
- Editor Mode: Allow teachers/content creators to build/preview exercises with live visualization.

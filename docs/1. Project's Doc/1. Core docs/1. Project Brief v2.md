## Project Brief: BassNotion Platform (Updated Draft)

**1. Project Title:** BassNotion Platform

**2. Project Goal:** To develop a web-based platform for bass players of all levels, providing interactive exercises and learning tools to improve their skills. The platform will leverage YouTube tutorials, allowing users to practice along with their favorite videos, guided by visual cues and synchronized audio tools. The core experience revolves around modular, specialized practice widgets that can be used individually or aggregated within a central Bass Drills Widget.

**3. Target Audience:** Bass players of all skill levels, from beginners to advanced players, who want to improve their technique, rhythm, harmony, and overall musicianship.

**4. Core Value Proposition:** BassNotion empowers bass players to learn and practice more effectively by:

- Turning YouTube tutorials into interactive exercises.
- Providing modular, specialized practice widgets (rhythm, harmony, articulation, etc.) that can be used independently or combined.
- Offering synchronized visual cues (fretboard display) and audio tools (metronome, loops) for guided practice.
- Creating a structured learning path with organized content.

**5. Key Features:**

- **User Management & Profile:** User registration, authentication, profile management, skill level assessment (ZERO Mission), badge management, and token balance.
- **Core Playback Engine:** A foundational, shared service providing tempo/pitch control, metronome, drummer loops, and reference audio playback capabilities used across all widgets.
- **Bass Drills Composite Widget:** The central, overarching container that integrates and unifies the individual specialized practice widgets into a comprehensive practice experience.
- **Individual Practice Widgets (Usable Individually or within Bass Drills):**
  - **Connection Widget:** Trains fretboard navigation, positions, and transitions across strings/frets with looping exercises and visual guidance.
  - **Rhythm Widget:** Offers structured rhythm training with a customizable drummer module, advanced metronome functions (accents, silent beats, subdivisions), interactive notation, and note length training, supporting polyrhythms.
  - **Recording Widget:** Captures user performances with real-time waveform display, playback, storage (Supabase), and automatic tagging for self-evaluation and future analysis.
  - **Articulation Widget:** Provides targeted exercises for techniques like hammer-ons, pull-offs, bends, ghost notes, and accents with visualization and feedback.
  - **Lick Widget:** A curated and expandable library of iconic bass licks, playable with various controls and trackable progress.
  - **Harmony Widget:** Hands-on music theory training via interactive fretboard/notation, covering scales, arpeggios, chords, and harmonic analysis.
  - **Technique Widget:** Systematic training for left and right-hand techniques, including warmups and advanced etudes, focusing on speed, strength, and accuracy.
  - **Imitation Widget:** Call-and-response system for ear training and stylistic development with AI analysis feedback.
- **YouTube Exerciser Widget:** This widget orchestrates and configures the individual practice widgets based on processed YouTube video analysis, dynamically setting up exercises, providing fretboard display cues ("WHAT to play"), timing ("WHEN to play it"), and synchronized audio playback (metronome, drums, loops).
- **Learning Path & Content Management:** Structured learning system (Story Arcs, Quests, Stages, Missions, Tasks), exercise library, and content delivery.
- **Integrations:** External services (n8n for YouTube processing, Supabase for data, Stripe for payments) and potential third-party APIs.
- **Performance & Technical Foundations:** Scalable, secure, and performant platform addressing non-functional requirements.

**6. Technical Overview:**

- **Core Framework & Architecture:**
  - **Monorepo Architecture:** Nx for monorepo management.
  - **Package Management:** pnpm.
  - **TypeScript:** With ES2022 target.
  - **Module System:** ESM (ES Modules).
  - **Build System:** Vite as the primary build tool, with project-specific configurations and `vite-plugin-static-copy`.
  - **Architectural Style:** Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is foundational across the entire platform, emphasizing clear bounded contexts and modularity.
- **Frontend (Next.js Application):**
  - Next.js framework, React.
  - ESM-based imports/exports.
  - Domain-driven design structure (`/domains/widgets/components/`).
  - UI components: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui.
- **Backend (NestJS Application):**
  - NestJS framework.
  - Fastify as HTTP server.
  - ESM-based imports/exports.
  - Domain-driven design structure.
- **Database & Infrastructure:**
  - Supabase Integration.
- **Payment Processing:** Stripe.
- **Testing & Quality:**
  - **Testing Framework:** Vitest.
  - **Code Quality:** ESLint and Prettier.
  - Standardized testing configuration through Nx Vite executor.

**7. Key Epics (as of May 25, 2025):**

1.  User Management & Profile
2.  Core Playback Engine
3.  **Bass Drills Composite Widget & Individual Practice Widgets (Central Epic for widget development)**
4.  YouTube Exerciser Widget (Configuration & Orchestration of other widgets)
5.  Learning Path & Content Management
6.  Performance & Technical Foundations
7.  Integrations & Administration

**8. Focus for MVP:**

- **Core Playback Engine** (foundational shared service)
- **Bass Drills Composite Widget** (central container and orchestrator)
- **All 7 Individual Practice Widgets** (basic implementations to validate system architecture):
  - **Connection Widget** (basic fretboard navigation exercises)
  - **Rhythm Widget** (basic metronome and simple drum patterns)
  - **Recording Widget** (basic audio recording and playback)
  - **Articulation Widget** (basic technique exercises and visual feedback)
  - **Lick Widget** (basic lick library with simple playback)
  - **Harmony Widget** (basic scale/chord visualization and exercises)
  - **Technique Widget** (basic warmup exercises and progress tracking)
  - **Imitation Widget** (basic call-and-response without AI analysis)
- **YouTube Exerciser Widget** (basic orchestration of the 7 widgets based on video analysis)
- **Shared Visualization Components** (basic SheetPlayer and FretboardVisualizer)
- **Basic User Management** (authentication, profiles, preferences)

**MVP Strategy:** Build all widgets in basic form to validate the complete system architecture, widget integration patterns, and user workflows. Advanced features (AI analysis, complex polyrhythms, advanced theory, etc.) will be added in subsequent iterations once the foundational system is proven and stable.

**9. Development Phases:**

**Phase 1 - MVP (Basic Widget Implementation):**

- All 7 widgets with core functionality only
- Basic shared visualization components
- Simple widget integration within Bass Drills composite
- Basic YouTube Exerciser orchestration
- Foundational user management and playback engine

**Phase 2 - Enhanced Features:**

- Advanced widget features (AI analysis, complex polyrhythms, advanced theory)
- Enhanced visualization capabilities
- Advanced learning path integration
- Comprehensive analytics and progress tracking

**Phase 3 - Platform Expansion:**

- Advanced AI-powered features
- Social features and community integration
- Advanced content management and curation tools
- Third-party integrations and API ecosystem

**10. Open Questions / Areas for Further Clarification:**

- Detailed UI/UX design and wireframes for each widget and their integration.
- Specific content strategy and initial exercise data for the individual widgets.
- Definition of "basic" vs "advanced" features for each widget to guide Phase 1 development.

**11. Next Steps:**

- Confirm finalization of this updated Project Brief with all 7 widgets in MVP scope.
- Define specific "basic" feature sets for each widget to guide Phase 1 development.
- Create detailed user stories for all 7 widgets focusing on core functionality.
- Begin development with **Epic 2: Core Playback Engine** and **Epic 3: Bass Drills Composite Widget & Individual Practice Widgets**.
- Establish widget integration patterns and shared component architecture early in development.

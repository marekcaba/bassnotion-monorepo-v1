# Epic 0: Project Initialization and Setup

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (100% - READY FOR DEVELOPMENT)

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to be properly initialized and the repository set up with the necessary structure and configurations, so that I can start developing the BassNotion platform efficiently.

**Context:** This epic is the very first step in the project. It outlines the tasks required to initialize the project, set up the repository, configure essential tools, and establish the foundational structure. It ensures that the development environment is ready for subsequent feature implementation. This epic is critical for setting the stage for all future development work.

## Detailed Requirements

1.  ~~**Repository Initialization:**~~
    * ~~Initialize a new Git repository.~~
    * ~~Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files and directories.~~
    * ~~Create a `README.md` file with basic project information.~~
    * Set up the initial project structure as defined in `docs/project-structure.md`.

2.  **Frontend Setup:**
    * Initialize the frontend project using the specified technology stack (e.g., React with TypeScript).
    * Install necessary frontend dependencies.
    * Configure the frontend build process.
    * Set up basic routing.
    * Establish global state management.

3.  **Backend Setup:**
    * Initialize the backend project using the specified technology stack (e.g., Node.js with Express).
    * Install necessary backend dependencies.
    * Configure the backend server.
    * Set up the database connection (Supabase).
    * Configure API endpoints.

4.  **CI/CD Pipeline Setup:**
    * Configure a CI/CD pipeline for automated builds, tests, and deployments.
    * Set up GitHub Actions workflows (or similar).
    * Configure automated deployment to environments (development, staging, production).

5.  ~~**Documentation Setup:**~~
    * ~~Set up the documentation structure.~~
    * Integrate documentation tools (if necessary).
    * ~~Ensure all existing documentation files are placed in the correct locations.~~

6.  **Tooling and Configuration:**
    * Configure linting and formatting tools (e.g., ESLint, Prettier).
    * Set up environment variables.
    * Configure any other necessary development tools.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

-   AC1: A Git repository is initialized with a proper `.gitignore` and `README.md`.
-   AC2: The frontend project is set up with the specified technology stack and dependencies.
-   AC3: The backend project is set up with the specified technology stack and dependencies, including database connection.
-   AC4: A CI/CD pipeline is configured for automated builds, tests, and deployments.
-   AC5: The documentation structure is established, and existing documentation is integrated.
-   AC6: Necessary tooling and configurations (linting, formatting, environment variables) are set up.
-   AC7: The project structure adheres to `docs/project-structure.md`.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

-   **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Create: `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and all files and directories as per `docs/project-structure.md`.
    * Files to Modify: None initially.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for detailed structure.)_

-   **Key Technologies:**
    * Git, Node.js, React, TypeScript, Express, Supabase, GitHub Actions, ESLint, Prettier.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for the full list.)_

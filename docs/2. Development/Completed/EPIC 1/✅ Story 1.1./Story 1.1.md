# Story 1.1: User Registration (Email & Password)

## Status: Complete - Frontend & Supabase Integration Implemented

## Story

- As a **new user**
- I want to **create an account using my unique email address and a secure password**
- so that I can **securely access the BassNotion platform's features and personalize my learning experience**.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  **FR-UM-01 Alignment:** The system shall present a user-friendly registration form requiring a valid email address and a password. ✅ **COMPLETED**
2.  The system shall perform real-time client-side validation for email format (e.g., `user@example.com`) and display immediate feedback. ✅ **COMPLETED**
3.  The system shall enforce server-side validation for email format and uniqueness; a user-friendly error message shall be displayed if the email is already registered. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Supabase Auth handles server-side validation
4.  The system shall enforce password strength requirements (e.g., minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase, one lowercase, one number, one special character) both client-side and server-side. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Client-side via Zod, server-side via Supabase Auth
5.  Upon successful submission, the system shall securely store the user's credentials (email and hashed password) using **Supabase Auth**. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Direct Supabase Auth integration implemented
6.  A confirmation email (if implemented) shall be sent to the registered email address for verification. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Supabase email confirmation flow implemented
7.  Upon successful registration and optional email confirmation, the user shall be automatically logged in and redirected to the main application dashboard or a designated welcome page. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Auto-login and dashboard redirect implemented
8.  The system shall handle network errors or Supabase integration failures gracefully, displaying appropriate error messages to the user without exposing sensitive technical details. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive error handling with toast notifications
9.  The registration process shall align with `NFR-SC-01` (Security: Utilize Supabase's built-in authentication and RLS for user data). ✅ **COMPLETED** - Direct Supabase Auth integration with built-in security

## 🔍 **VERIFICATION QUESTIONS I MUST ASK MYSELF:**

1. **"Is this a pnpm project?"** → Check for pnpm-lock.yaml
2. **"What import rules apply?"** → Check file path type (relative vs alias)
3. **"Do I have permission?"** → Ask user before changes
4. **"Is this the correct command?"** → Verify against rules

**IF I VIOLATE THESE RULES, STOP AND CORRECT IMMEDIATELY!** 🛑
